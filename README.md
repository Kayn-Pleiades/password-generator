## process

### Commit 1: Initial commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Base files
Copied files for homework into the folder.

### Commit 3: First Prompt
My first goal: When the button is clicked, a prompt appears that prints to the box.
Then in next steps, I'll expand on this. 

### Commit 4: Password Length
Next goal: Prompt asks for pasword length. If they provide a number that is not in the range, it will tell them and ask again. If number is in the range, it moves on.
